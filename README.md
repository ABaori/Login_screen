# Login_screen

Template for login and sign  up for an app.

For storage of data and authorisation I am using Firebase cloud authentication. To us this code you should login to your Firebase account and create a project and
and add it's dependencies in your gradle module, this can also be done in your android Studio and you can find the option to do so in "Tools".
If you don't see an option of Firebase there, go in your file config and enable firebase plugin.

About the App:
This is a simple template for login and sign up and can be implemented directly if your starting with an app.
